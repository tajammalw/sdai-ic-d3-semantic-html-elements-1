# Semantic HTML Elements Lab 1 - Try it Yourself

## Description 📄
In this Try It Yourself activity, you'll be code detectives! We'll start with some classic, non-semantic HTML. Then, we'll leverage the power of generative AI to see how it suggests making the code more meaningful.  By the end, you'll be able to identify generic elements, grasp the power of semantic HTML, and build your own well-structured web pages using elements like `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<section>`. Get ready to code like a pro!

## Developer Objectives 📋

**Refactor generic elements:** Replacing generic elements with semantic ones.
**Using generative AI:** Use generative AI to refactor a codebase ethically and professionally.
**Embrace semantic elements:** Reading the response from generative AI on the reason for the use of semantic elements.

## ToDo list ✅
**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

1. [ ] Choose which generative AI you would like to use. 
2. [ ] Write a prompt using your prompt engineering skills asking the AI to refactor the HTML into semantic HTML for you. 
3. [ ] Copy the HTML document and paste it in the generative AI after your prompt.
4. [ ] Watch the AI work.
5. [ ] Note the changes that AI made to your document. 
   1. What is different? 
   2. What stayed the same?
   3. Did the AI give any explanations?
6. [ ] Copy and paste the refactored code to your codespace and save it. You will use it in the next activity.
